# Introduction
In this analysis, we would like to identify what variables has an impact to income. As part of descriptive analysis, we can also drill down on how people from different level of income behave in terms of their spending and/or consumption.

## Hypothesis (Work In Progress)
The current hypothesis is that the following variables might have an impact to income on an individual level.

- *Level of education.* As previously mentioned, higher level of education might increase the likelihood of people to get a higher income level.
- *Region they reside in.* Different regions might have different level of minimum wage, which might have an impact of level of income.
- *Age.* Age might infer level of experience. Hopefully, we would be able to see if there is indeed any age discrimination in the work force.
- *Gender.* Hopefully, we would be able to see if there is indeed any sex discrimination in the work force, and any pay gap.
- *Marital Status.* Whether they are married, single, or divorced.
- *Moved.* Whether they have moved from their place of birth.
- *Sector and Sector Group.* The Sector/Industry of their current occupation, or the Sector Group based on three-sector model.
- *Urban.* whether they live in an urban area.
- *District, Provinces, Island.* The location of their current place of residence.

# Phases

## Iteration 1: Data Preparation, Exploration, Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Agita's Attempt
My attempt of Iteration 1 is thoroughly explained here: https://www.notion.so/agitasesara/Agita-Iteration-1-Description-and-Results-529dbcb68bef4963b652bdfc2d814737.
The jupyter notebook has also been uploaded to main branch.

#### Exploration Dashboard
To ease with data exploration, a data studio dashboard was created. The purpose of this exploration dashboard is just to understand the data better, and make decision of the direction of our analysis. **This dashboard should not be treated as the final output.** Link to dashboard: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8b201dc3-0f4c-490c-88b9-5f7fecea02ae

## Iteration 2: Finalization of Analysis & Building Report and/or Dashboard
In this stage, based on exploration done in iteration 1, we created a final data studio dashboard with findings. You can see the final dashboard here: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/e3ad8275-58c4-4b77-bcae-3f76339bd43c 

We were planning to also add consumption data as an addition for descriptive analysis, specifically, to show how different individuals with different income levels have differing consumption behavior. However, sadly, we did not have enough time for this.

## Iteration 3: Modeling
In this iteration, we attempted to do modeling, specifically OLS and Logistic Regression, however, we did not have enough time to finish this in time. We have uploaded the jupyter notebook in case it's needed. In the last attempt, we were able to get an accuracy of 75% of predicting whether someone would have a neet income higher than their district weighted average.

# Current Blocker

## NOT ENOUGH TIME
We did not have enough time to do everything we plan to do :( If given more time we would love to finish what we set out to do.

## I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE GITHUB LOL
- I really don't understand how to make folders, I'm so sorry :(
- I think I mistakenly created a new branch to start a pull request (???) I dont even know what this means and I cant delete it :(
