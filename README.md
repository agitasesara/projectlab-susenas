# Introduction
In this analysis, we would like to identify what variables has an impact to income. As part of descriptive analysis, we can also drill down on how people from different level of income behave in terms of their spending and/or consumption.

## Hypothesis (Work In Progress)
The current hypothesis is that the following variables might have an impact to income on an individual level.

- *Level of education.* As previously mentioned, higher level of education might increase the likelihood of people to get a higher income level.
- *Region they reside in.* Different regions might have different level of minimum wage, which might have an impact of level of income.
- *Age.* Age might infer level of experience. Hopefully, we would be able to see if there is indeed any age discrimination in the work force.
- *Gender.* Hopefully, we would be able to see if there is indeed any sex discrimination in the work force, and any pay gap.

# Current Progress
We are currently still in **Iteration 1** where each member do their own data preparation, exploration, exploratory data analysis, and data visualizations within jupyter notebook. By Sunday, 20 June 2021, we wil regroup and discuss / plan for **Iteration 2**, where we will finalize the analysis and work towards building a final report and dashboard

## Iteration 1: Data Preparation, Exploration, Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Agita's Attempt
My attempt of Iteration 1 is thoroughly explained here: https://www.notion.so/agitasesara/Agita-Iteration-1-Description-and-Results-529dbcb68bef4963b652bdfc2d814737.
The jupyter notebook has also been uploaded to main branch.

#### Exploration Dashboard
To ease with data exploration, a data studio dashboard was created. The purpose of this exploration dashboard is just to understand the data better, and make decision of the direction of our analysis. **This dashboard should not be treated as the final output.** Link to dashboard: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8b201dc3-0f4c-490c-88b9-5f7fecea02ae

## Iteration 2: Finalization of Analysis & Building Report and/or Dashboard
In this stage, based on exploration done in iteration 1, we created a final data studio dashboard with findings. You can see the final dashboard here: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/e3ad8275-58c4-4b77-bcae-3f76339bd43c 

## Iteration 3: Modeling
In **Iteration 3**, we will attempt to do modeling. Our current plan, and based on feedback from the mentors.

# Current Blocker

## I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE GITHUB LOL
I think I mistakenly created a new branch to start a pull request (???) I dont even know what this means and I cant delete it :(
