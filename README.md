# Introduction
We cannot optimize what we do not measure. This means, to support the success of this newly-founded ecommerce, we have to ensure that decision makers have clear visibility of key metrics and dimensions in order to empower them to make strategic moves and develop clear action plans for different teams.

As they are a newly-founded ecommerce, they currently do not have this visibility. Hence, we propose to build a performance monitoring dashboard as a solution.

# Objective
The objective of this solution is to provide stakeholders, in this case decision makers in the newly-founded ecommerce, with a monitoring dashboard regarding three (3) different aspects:
Sales performance for C-level and operations team
Marketing Performance for marketing team
A/B Test Results for Business Development team

With this monitoring dashboard, each stakeholder can have a top-level view of the business health from different aspects, and make quick decisions or changes in strategy based on the insights if required to ensure fulfillment of the companyâ€™s goals.

# Stakeholder Persona
The stakeholders of this product are:
- C-level or management
- Operations team
- Marketing Team
- Business Development team

Each stakeholders have different needs and different key metrics and dimensions they will need to evaluate. There will be a homepage where general metrics will be shown, and different sections on different pages with specific requirements from each stakeholder.

# Solutions Mapping
There are three (3) aspects that will need to be covered by this performance monitoring dashboard, which will be detailed below.

## Sales Performance
Sales dashboard is created to identify total sales or order sales by adding features that directly impact to measure enhancement sales or order sales. To understand how the growth of sales, the dashboard can be optimized by creating a feature that can show the review of customers toward the product. It is hoped that products that get bad reviews can be easily detected and handled effectively as soon as possible.

## Marketing Performance
The marketing team is monitoring customers' activity on the website to assess the impact of website campaigns to customer purchases. There are five different campaigns displayed on the website. The available dataset is used to determine which marketing campaign is the most successful, what products have the highest selling level, and investigate customer profiles and purchasing behavior on different website campaigns. The most effective campaigns from the experiment can be adopted for future implementation.

## A/B Test Result
The business development team is doing an A/B test experiment on the company website to test the effectiveness of the new landing page. Based on the experiment result, we need to determine whether the new landing page that was tested should be adopted or not by performing a hypothesis testing. Should the result of the hypothesis testing suggest that the new landing page showed a statistically significant performance compared to the control group, the new landing page will be implemented.

Hypothesis testing will be done using the frequentist method.
